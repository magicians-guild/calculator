# Instructions 

## Asking for Help

You are encouraged to and expected to ask for help. Either from me or your fellow students. You are also expected to look up some things on your own as these instructions do not give all the information you need to know to complete the assignment. There's a balance to be struck between struggling through it yourself and knowing when to ask for help. 

As a guideline, if you spend more than an hour "stuck" on any part of the assignment by yourself, please know that you can message me, or post a message in `#homework-discussion`.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local computer (e.g with GitHub Desktop as we did with "The First Lesson")
2. Open this directory and repository in Visual Studio Code

## Assignment

### Part 1

At the start, the page is just a list of numbers in divs. We are going to add CSS styling to make it look more like a calculator.

Only modify files in the directory with your name. If you mess up, you can start over with the `starting_template` files. 

Add to the single `index.html` file in the `part-1-single-file` directory:

1. Add CSS styling to the numbers so that the numbers are in a row instead of column
   1. Commit changes in git
   2. 
   3. Push changes to GitHub
2. Add CSS styling to the numbers such that there's a visible box around them and look like buttons
   1. Commit changes in git
   2. Push changes to GitHub
3. Add CSS styling so that hovering over the buttons changes their appearance.
   1. Commit changes in git
   2. Push changes to GitHub
4. Add Javascript code so that pressing down on the buttons changes their appearance
   1. Commit changes in git
   2. Push changes to GitHub

### Part 2

Now you will begin working in the `part-2-multiple-files` directory under your name

1. From `part-1-single-file/index.html`, copy everything between the `<style>` tag into `style.css`.
   1. Commit changes in git
   2. Push changes to GitHub
2. From `part-1-single-file/index.html`, copy everything between the `<script>` tag into `script.js`.
   1. Commit changes in git
   2. Push changes to GitHub
3. Delete the `part-1-single-file` directory
   1. Commit changes in git
   2. Push changes to GitHub

### Bonus

1. Add a favicon to your page
2. Make the `#input-area` div change contents based on what button was pressed using Javascript
3. Have another student make a change to your calculator and be able to pull down and incorporate those changes.
