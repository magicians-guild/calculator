# Instructions 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local computer (e.g with GitHub Desktop as we did with "The First Lesson")
2. Open this directory and repository in Visual Studio Code

## Assignment

### Part 1

At the start, the page is just a list of numbers in divs. We are going to add CSS styling to make it look more like a calculator.

Only modify files in the directory with your name. If you mess up, you can start over with the `starting_template` files. 

Add to the single `index.html` file in the `part-1-single-file` directory:

1. Add CSS styling to the numbers so that the numbers are in a row instead of column
   1. Commit changes to GitHub
   2. Push changes to GitHub
2. Add CSS styling to the numbers such that there's a visible box around them and look like buttons
   1. Commit changes to GitHub
   2. Push changes to GitHub
3. Add CSS styling so that hovering over the buttons changes their appearance.
   1. Commit changes to GitHub
   2. Push changes to GitHub
4. Add Javascript code so that pressing down on the buttons changes their appearance
   1. Commit changes to GitHub
   2. Push changes to GitHub

### Part 2

Now you will begin working in the `part-2-multiple-files` directory under your name

1. From `part-1-single-file/index.html`, copy everything between the `<style>` tag into `style.css`.
   1. Commit changes to GitHub
   2. Push changes to GitHub
2. From `part-1-single-file/index.html`, copy everything between the `<script>` tag into `script.js`.
   1. Commit changes to GitHub
   2. Push changes to GitHub
3. Delete the `part-1-single-file` directory
   1. Commit changes to GitHub
   2. Push changes to GitHub
